How time flies, I have been working at my current job for 4 years now.
There are several benefits to work here, from my point of view.
Here they are:

1. Surf beyond GFW
1. O'Reilly and Lynda.com subscription
One is for books, and the other one is for videos. I can learn anyting I am interested in on those two sites.
1. Work from home

1. Felxible working time and long vacation
1. MacBook Pro and external monitor
