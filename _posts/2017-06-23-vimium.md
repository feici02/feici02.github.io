Vim is my default text editor, and Chrome is my default browser.
It would be nice if I can use the Vim-like keyboard shortcuts to surf the internet with Chrome.

So I use [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/), which is a Chrome extension.
After installing and enabling it, just hit ```?``` for the complete usage.
Use it as often as possible until your muscle memory is formed.

Finally, I'd like to give a shout-out for the following features:
- b/B: search in your bookmarks, then open it in current/new tab
- o/O: search in your bookmarks and histories, then open it in current/new tab
- T: search currently open tabs, then switch to it

It's just like Spotlight on macOS, but for Chrome.
