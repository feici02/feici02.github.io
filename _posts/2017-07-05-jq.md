```jq``` is a powerful and easy-to-use JSON processor on command line. Here are 3 examples of how I use it in my daily work.

## 1. Pretty-print the output of curl
When you call a REST API, which returns JSON as response, you can use it to make the reponse more readable like this:
```
curl https://api.example.com/... | jq
```

## 2. Use in Vim
I have the following lines in my ```.vimrc``` file:
```
" user jq to format JSON file
nmap =j :%!jq '.'<CR>
```
When I eidt JSON file with Vim, I can just hit ```=j```, it will be formatted instantly.

## 3. Extract fields in JSON
```jq``` can also extract certain fields in JSON. Here is an example to get the names of all my repos on Github:
```
curl https://api.github.com/users/feici02/repos | jq '.[].name'
```

For more infomation, please refer to ```man jq```.
