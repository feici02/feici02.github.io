Today, I decided to give fish a try.

## Install
```
brew install fish
```

## Set *fish* as the default shell (optional)
Add the following line to /etc/shells:
```
/usr/local/bin/fish
```
Then, run following command:
```
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
```

## Customize
Run `fish_config` and configure fish on a webpage.
