title:  "Two Tools for the PEP8 Enforcement"
tags: python
---

Two tools to help you to follow the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. [Here](http://pep8.org/) is a more readable version of this guide.

## 1. flake8

### Install
```
$ pip3 install flake8
```

### Usage
Check all the files in current directory and its sub-directory, but skipping the `venv` directory.
```
$ flake8 --exclude=venv .
```
To avoid run above command with the `--exclude` option every time, you can add the `.flake8` file in current directory with the contents below:
```
[flake8]
exclude = venv
```
If you want to enable above configuraiton globally, you can put it in `~/.config/flake8`.


Run `flake8 --help` for complete usage.

## 2. autopep8
Some of the errors found by `flake8` can be fixed automatically by `autopep8`.

### Install
```
$ pip3 install autopep8
```

### Usage
To modify a file in place (with aggressive level 2):
```
$ autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive <filename>
# or
$ autopep8 -i -a -a <filename>
```

Run `autopep8 --help` for complete usage.

## 3. Use them in Vim

It will be great if these two tools can be used directly in Vim, so I use following Vim plugins:
- vim-flake8
- vim-autoformat


If you use `Vundle` to manage Vim plugins like I do, just add followng two lines in your `.vimrc` file:
```
Plugin 'nvie/vim-flake8'
Plugin 'Chiel92/vim-autoformat'
```
And then, run `:PluginInstall` in Vim to install them.

Also, add following to lines in `.vimrc`, so that they can be triggered with F3 and F4, respectively.
```
noremap <F3> :Autoformat<CR>
autocmd FileType python map <buffer> <F4> :call Flake8()<CR>
```
